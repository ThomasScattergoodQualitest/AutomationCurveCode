This assignment contains my own framework for writing an automated test case for the provided
website

I ran into an issue with locating the button element on the second page and spent a long time 
trying to solve it with no success, despite being able to locate the specifi element in the
elements and console tabs of chrome developer tools 

I also ran out of time due to this problem so the framework for the last page isn't complete 
but would follow a very similar framework to the first 3 pages 

test_end_to_end_book_hotel_room.py is the main test case
